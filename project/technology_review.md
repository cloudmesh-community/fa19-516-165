# Technology Review -- Auto Machine Learning in Clouds

## Brief
In all three major cloud services: Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure, the
providers offers machine learning as a service (MLaaS) to help their clients to customize their machine learning models.
The concept of MLaaS, similar to Software as a service (SaaS), is a series infrastructure for machine learning pipelines, 
such as data management, pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, model training and tuning, and model
evaluation. 

With different needs business needs, all most all cloud service providers are offering MLaaS and integrated it with their
platform. For example, Google has Cloud AutoML for Sight, Language, and Structured Data. AWS has its own product, Amazon 
SageMaker, to help clients deploy rapid machine learning model. Microsoft Azure Machine Learning has the similar services.
 
## Comparision of Different MLaaS

MLasS across the three platforms are different and have their own features. Generally speaking, to meet their clients' 
needs, the service providers usually provide the following service, including regression, recommendation, classification,
and anomaly detection. From the review, we can conclude that the Microsoft Azure provide the most comprehensive services
compared to the other two services. 

|                   | Amazon SageMaker | Microsoft Azure Machine Learning | Google AutoML |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|
| Regression        | Yes              | Yes                             | Yes           |
| Classification    | Yes              | Yes                             | Yes           |
| Recommendation    | No               | Yes                             | No            |
| Anomaly Detection | No               | Yes                             | Yes           |

For all of the platforms, besides the auto machine learning feature, they also support different third part machine 
learning frameworks, including Keras, TensorFlow, Pytorch, and SKlearn. 

## Clouds in Healthcare Industry

Healthcare is an industry with slow pace to take new technology. There are two reasons cause this situations: first, 
the previous well-established system/technology has inertia to resist the change. Second, the as a highly regulated 
industry, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules in details on how to handle patient data. 
But all major companies has been releases HIPAA compliant services to help clients take advantage of  

However, the trends of transforming traditional data centers to cloud services also impact on healthcare industry. All 
major technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, are trying to jump into the healthcare market and 
provides services. For example, Google amd Microsoft partnered with different healthcare major stakeholders, such as 
hospitals, insurance company, and pharmacies. Different with the other two competitors, Amazon takes different 
strategies and trying to directly compete with other healthcare companies. For example, Amazon bought a online pharmacy
company, PillPack, to directly join in the healthcare competition. This is the reason why healthcare companies are 
willing to use Microsoft and Google's services instead of Amazon.
