Biomass is a method to provide energy to data centers other than solar, wind,
hydro, or recyclers. It utilizes the wastes from cities to generate electricity
as power to support the operation of data centers.[2]

According to Vineyard Data Center website and Biomass Magazine, HP Lab Vineyard
Data Center Park uses biomass as their main fuel.[2,3]

On Jan 23, 2017, United Airlines suffered from a IT data center outage. This
outage prevented United Airlines pilots from getting key data and passengers
could not check their flights' information from internet. Thus, the company on
that day cancelled 200 flights due to the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA)
ground stop for the its scheduled flights.[5] It assumed
that on average, 200 passengers on one domestic flights. In total, over 4,000
passengers had to reschedule their travel. On average, the net profit for one passengers
for the top seven airlines was about $17.75 [6]. Thus, due to this outage, United
Airlines lost at least $71,000 net profit from cancelled flights. At the same
time, the company also delayed 4,000 flight. This number did not count for the
costs of reschedule passengers' travel, compensated passengers' time, reputation
damages, and potential fine from the FAA.
